When you want to perform a particular task that you’ve defined in a function, you call
the function responsible for it.
Using functions makes your programs easier to write, read, test, and fix.
You can store functions in separate files called modules to help organize your main program files.
* keyword def to inform Python that you’re defining a function. This is the function definition,
  which tells Python the name of the function
* The parentheses hold that information.
* lines that follow def greet_user(): make up the body of the function.
* The text on the second line is a comment called a docstring, which describes what the function does.
* When Python generates documentation for the functions in your programs, it looks for a string
  immediately after the function's definition. These strings are usually enclosed in triple quotes,
  which lets you write multiple lines.
* When you want to use this function, you have to call it. A function call tells Python to execute
  the code in the function. To call a function, you write the name of the function, followed by any
  necessary information in parentheses.
* a parameter, a piece of information the function needs to do its job.


Python capitalize() and title() are 2 inbuilt functions used for string handling.

title() – Python title() method returns a title cased string by converting the initial letter
of each word to a capital letter.

capitalize() – The capitalize() method only capitalizes the first character of the string i.e.
it converts only the first letter of the input string into uppercase and others to lowercase.
