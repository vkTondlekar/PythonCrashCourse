NOTE
The best way to understand new programming concepts is to try using them in your programs. If you get stuck while working on 
an exercise in this book, try doing something else for a while. If you’re still stuck, review the relevant part of that chapter. 
If you still need help, see the suggestions in Appendix C.

	The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. 
	You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have special meanings 
	that we’ll discuss in later chapters
	
	variables as labels that you can assign to values.
