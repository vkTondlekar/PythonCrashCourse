In this chapter, you learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information
in your programs. You learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use
while loops to make your programs run as long as your users want them to. You saw several ways
to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement,
and using the continue statement. You learned how to use a while loop to move items from
one list to another and how to remove all instances of a value from a list. You also learned
how while loops can be used with dictionaries.
