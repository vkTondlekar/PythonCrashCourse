Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three
favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their
favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
